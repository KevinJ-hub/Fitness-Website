        <h1>YOGA</h1>

    <hr>
    <p>Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual
        practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six Āstika (orthodox) schools of
        Indian philosophical traditions.<br>
        There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.
        The term "Yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise, consisting
        largely of the postures or asanas.<br>
        The practice of yoga has been thought to date back to pre-vedic Indian traditions; possibly in the Indus valley
        civilization around 3000 BCE. Yoga is mentioned in the Rigveda, and also referenced in the
        Upanishads, though it most likely developed as a systematic study around the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, in
        ancient India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements. The chronology of earliest texts describing
        yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to the Upanishads. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the
        2nd century BCE, and gained prominence in the west in the 20th century after being first introduced by
        Swami Vivekananda. Hatha yoga texts began to emerge sometime between the 9th and 11th century with origins
        in tantra.<br>
        Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West, following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the
        late 19th and early 20th century with his adaptation of yoga tradition, excluding asanas. Outside India, it
        has developed into a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique. Yoga in Indian
        traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core. One of the
        six major orthodox schools of Indian philosophy is also called Yoga, which has its own epistemology, ontology
        and metaphysics, and is closely related to Samkhya philosophy.</p>

            <td>This type of yoga uses ancient yoga teachings. However, it became popular during the 1970s. Ashtanga
                applies six established sequences of postures that rapidly link every movement to breath.</td>

            <td>Also known as “hot” yoga, Bikram occurs in artificially heated rooms at temperatures of nearly 105
                degrees and 40 percent humidity. It consists of 26 poses and a sequence of two breathing exercises.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Hatha yoga</td>
            <td>This is a generic term for any type of yoga that teaches physical postures. “Hatha” classes usually
                serve as a gentle introduction to the basic yoga postures.</td>

            <td>Iyengar yoga</td>

                blankets, straps, chairs, and bolsters.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Jivamukti yoga</td>
            <td>Jivamukti means “liberation while living.” This type emerged in 1984 and incorporates spiritual
                teachings and practices that focus on the fast-paced flow between poses rather than the poses
                themselves.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Kripalu yoga</td>
            <td>This type teaches practitioners to know, accept, and learn from the body. A student of Kripalu learns to
                find their own level of practice by looking inward. The classes usually begin with breathing exercises
                and gentle stretches, followed by a series of individual poses and final relaxation.</td>
